## 📝 Development Notes

### Technical Decisions Made
- **ExcelJS over xlsx**: Chosen for better maintenance and TypeScript support
- **@dnd-kit over react-dnd**: More modern, better performance
- **localStorage over file system**: Simpler for MVP, can enhance later
- **Tailwind 4.0**: CSS-only config fits better with Electron build process

### Architecture Insights
- Component split needed: Current App.tsx approaching 500-line limit
- Consider React Context for global state management
- Electron security: Renderer process should be sandboxed
- Performance: Large staff lists may need virtualization

### User Feedback Integration Points
- [ ] Test with actual healthcare staff
- [ ] Validate Swedish terminology with native speakers
- [ ] Confirm room configuration matches real facility needs
- [ ] Verify Excel format matches existing staff databases
